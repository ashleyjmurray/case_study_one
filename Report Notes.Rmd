Questions:
- How are year of birth and type of leadership related to lifespan of leaders?
- Does any relationship between year of birth and lifespan depend on the type of leadership?
- What is the probability that the 14th Dalai Lama will have a longer lifespan than Pope Francis? 
- What is the probability that President Obama will have a longer lifespan than Emperor Naruhito?

Goals:
- Identify an excellent statistical model for predicting lifespan of selected world leaders.
- Provide a comprehensive interpretation of your model, explaining how year of birth and type of leadership are associated with longevity.
- Provide point and interval predictions of lifespan of living leaders in the data.
- Estimate and describe the posterior distribution of the probability that the 14th Dalai Lama will live longer than Pope Francis
- Estimate and describe the posterior distribution of the probability that President Obama will live longer than Emperor Naruhito

# To Do's:

- Other Notes
 - Fix Dalai Lama *done*
 - Cathy look at traceplots *done*
 - everyone verify code
 
## Code 
- Model diagnostics 
  - posterior predictive checks (Ashley)
  - residual plots (standardized?) (Matty) *done*
- Posterior Inference (answer questions)
  - sample many tries and average to get point/ interval estimate (Alice) - alr in the Bayesian_Popes_second_approach output
  - compare leaders (Cathy) *done*
  
## Report 
- Written Report
  - Provide Interpretation of alphas/ betas (Alice)
  - Describe Interaction (not significant?) (Alice)
- Report Graphs/ Tables
  - Lexis diagram (Ashley) **doesn't make sense**
  - Add other EDA plots? (anyone) - histograms of Age.Event and predictions
  - posterior distribution plots for 4 people of interest (Cathy) *done*
  - tidy output table (Matty) *done*
  - other interesting plots? (anyone)
  
- Report Outline
  - Intro (Matty) *done*
  - Body
      - Data (Matty) *done* 
      - Methods (everyone/ Zoom?)
      - Analysis (Alice + Cathy)
          - interpretations and diagnostics
      - Results  (Cathy + Ashley)
          - discuss probabilities/ etc
  - Conclusion / Discussion (everyone/ Zoom?)
      - above and beyond possible / further research
  - Appendix (all contribute code, etc.)
 
 
## End
  - comment/ clean-up code
  - make video (everyone/ Zoom?)

- Above and beyond/ Further research
  - somehow factor in GDP?
  
## NEW

- Finish the conclusion
- Do the video 
  - Cathy: Predictive posterior for the four leaders, lil trace plots(mcmc)
  - Matty: Introduction, Model/Motivating Model (introducing Weibull)
  - Alice: Interpretation of the Output, living people
  - Ashley: Conclusion
- Ashley: try to fix posterior predictive checks LOL, need to explain the plots outputted
- Cathy: fix posterior predictive plots
- Alice: add point estimate for all living people, add comparison to our prediction and the world live data
- Matty: 
    - fix the model table output *done*
    - fix the residuals again *done*
    - see what's happening with the residuals 
    - add explanation of the residual plots in the final report *done*
- Change function names *done*
- Comment on code
- Check reproducibility
- Add EDA to the data portion in the Final Report
