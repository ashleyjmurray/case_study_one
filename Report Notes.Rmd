Questions:
- How are year of birth and type of leadership related to lifespan of leaders?
- Does any relationship between year of birth and lifespan depend on the type of leadership?
- What is the probability that the 14th Dalai Lama will have a longer lifespan than Pope Francis? 
- What is the probability that President Obama will have a longer lifespan than Emperor Naruhito?

Goals:
- Identify an excellent statistical model for predicting lifespan of selected world leaders.
- Provide a comprehensive interpretation of your model, explaining how year of birth and type of leadership are associated with longevity.
- Provide point and interval predictions of lifespan of living leaders in the data.
- Estimate and describe the posterior distribution of the probability that the 14th Dalai Lama will live longer than Pope Francis
- Estimate and describe the posterior distribution of the probability that President Obama will live longer than Emperor Naruhito
