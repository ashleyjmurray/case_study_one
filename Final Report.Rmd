# I. Introduction

World leaders are influential people that have the power to impact millions of people's lives. Some leaders are elected for terms while others serve for life, so their expected survival is of great interest. In this paper, we seek to compare Popes, US Presidents, Dalai Lamas, Chinese Emperors, and Japanese Emperors to see how their lifespans compare. Additionally, we want to analyze the impact on survival of a leader's birth year, and whether or not this impact might vary depending on the type of leadership. After we build a model to analyze the effects, we also wish to look at some specific cases and determine the probability that the current 14th Dalai Lama will outlive Pope Francis and the probability that President Obama will outlive Emperor Naruhito. We will accomplish this by using survival analysis. We use Bayesian Inference to estimate the model parameters with the help of the JAGS program. 

The rest of the paper is structured as follows. First, we will describe the data used to carry out our analysis. Next, we will describe the methods used in our analysis plan. Then, we will show how we carried out our analysis plan and recount our results. After that, we discuss our conclusions and areas for further research. Finally, our code and some additional information can be foudn in the Appendix. 


# II. Data

The data used in this analysis contains entries for 177 different world leaders. The types of world leaders present in the data include Popes, US Presidents, Dalai Lamas, Chinese Emperors, and Japanese Emperors. Each leader's birth date type of leader is recorded. For some of these groups, we have data dating all the way back to the 14th century. Additionally, leaders who have passed away also have their death date and age of death recorded. For leaders that are still living, these columns instead contain the date the dataset was created (July 31, 2020) and their current age on that date. In order to further clarify who is dead or alive, there is a column titled "Censored," which takes a value of 0 if the person is still dead and a value of 1 if that person is still alive. Related to this, there is another column called "Fail," which takes on a value of 1 if the person is dead and a value of 0 if the person is alive. In total, there are 11 living leaders in our dataset, 4 of whose age of death we are trying to predict. 

# III. Methods

# IV. Analysis



The combination of traceplots, lag-1 scatterplots, and acf plots suggest the chain for each parameters converges, and that 50000 iterations is sufficient. The Rhat's are all close to 1, which is another indicator of converge. All of the effective sample sizes are greater than 200, except for that of beta_0 (the intercept) and r.

# V. Results
Our model predicts that the 85-year-old 14th Dalai Lama is expected to live 111 years (95% credible interval: 86 - 119 years), the 84-year-old Pope Francis is expected to live 105 years (95% credible interval: 86 - 119 years), the 60-year-old Janpanese Emperior Naruhito is expected to live 99 years (95% credible interval: 66 - 119 years) and the 60-year-old former President Obama is expected to live 99 years (95% credible interval: 65 - 119 years). *THE UPPER BOUND IS TOO HIGH*

The probability that the 14th Dalai Lama will have a longer lifespan than Pope Francis is 0.39. The probability that President Obama will have a longer lifespan than Emperor Naruhito is 0.51.

The posterior predictive distribution of the lifespan of Pope Francis is somewhat left skewed, with the mode in the 110s. The posterior predictive distribution of the lifespan of the 14th Dalai Lama is more uniform, with mode in the 90s. The posterior predictive distributions of the lifespans of President Obama and Emperor Naruhito are both left skewed, with the modes in the 110s.
